            <p><b><h4>Description:</h4></b>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a biodiverse hotspot and the last viable area of primary tropical rainforest in Sri Lanka.<br>
              It covers an area of 11,000 hectares, with more than 60% of its trees being endemic and many considered rare.<br>
              The forest is home to a variety of wildlife, including over 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic species of mammals and butterflies, as well as numerous birds, insects, reptiles, and amphibians. 
              The vegetation density is estimated to be around 240,000 plants per hectare, making it the most dense rainforest in Asia. 
              The forest reserve has been designated as a World Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
              It is also a living heritage, with a rich cultural and historical significance. 
              The region receives about ten months of rain per year, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 25°C.
              The forest is a narrow strip of undulating terrain, consisting of a series of ridges and valleys..</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b>Udawalawe National Park is located at the borders of Uva and Sabaragamuwa provinces in Sri Lanka.<br>
                  It was established in 1972 to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir.<br>
                 The park covers an area of 30,821 hectares and is the third most visited park in the country. 
                 It is known for being an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants, with around 600 elephants in the park in herds of up to 50.
                  The park's landscape resembles an African game park, with mainly thorny-shrub jungle and grasslands. In addition to elephants, the park is home to a variety of wildlife, including water buffalo, wild boar, spotted deer, sambur deer, jackals, and crocodiles.
                  The park offers ample elephant safari opportunities and is a popular tourist destination. </p>
