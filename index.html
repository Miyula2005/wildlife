                Sri Lanka's 2.14% lowland rainforests, exemplified by the UNESCO Sinharaja Forest Reserve, are vital
                ecosystems boasting rich biodiversity.
                With an annual rainfall of 2,500-1,800mm, Sinharaja preserves over 60% endemic trees, supporting 50% of
                the country's endemic mammals and butterflies.<br><br>
                Beyond borders, the reserve acts as a sanctuary for 70% of Sri Lanka's endemic species, serving
                essential ecosystem functions like watershed regulation.
                Dominated by Dipterocarpaceae trees, Sinharaja stands as a global ecological hotspot.
                Despite its compact size, the reserve underscores the delicate balance needed for biodiversity,
                emphasizing a global responsibility to preserve these natural treasures for present and future
                generations.

                The Dry Zone in Sri Lanka, housing the Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests, features flat
                topography and an annual 2,000 mm rainfall during the northeast monsoon.
                Stretching across the northern, eastern, and southeastern regions, it's crucial for agriculture, relying
                on rivers for irrigation.<br><br>
                Characterized by evergreen trees, distinct from deciduous ones, it defines the ecoregion. Development
                programs, like the Mahaweli Development Program, enhance crop production through farmer-managed
                irrigation.
                The Sri Lanka Dry-Zone Dry Evergreen Forests host over 6,000 Asian elephants, despite remaining mostly
                dry.
                With vital rivers for irrigation, the Dry Zone supports aquaculture development, contributing to
                sustainable agricultural practices and maintaining its dual identity as an agricultural hub and wildlife
                haven.

            <p class="sub-para-3"> Sri Lanka's Tropical Lower Montane Forests, situated above 1,000 m in the Central
                Highlands and Knuckles mountains, cover 1.1% of the land area, exhibiting optimal development above
                1,500 m.
                Characterized by unique floristic composition and simpler structures with canopies reaching around 30
                feet, approximately 50% of species here are exclusive to Sri Lanka.
                Cooler than lowland forests, these montane forests foster ideal conditions for cloud forest growth.
                <br><br>
                Covering 0.05% of Sri Lanka's total area, the montane rainforests on mountain tops like Pidurutalagala
                and Hakgala host half of the nation's endemic flowering plants and 51% of endemic vertebrates.
                At lower elevations (1,000–1,500 m), sub-montane forests cover 1.04% of the nation's area.
                Recognized as a super-hotspot within global endemic hotspots, the Sri Lanka montane rainforests are of
                immense ecological significance due to their rich biodiversity.
