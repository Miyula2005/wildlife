In December 2004, a tsunami struck Sri Lanka's coast, damaging Yala's vegetation and coastal features like lagoons and mangroves. A 2013 study assessed the recovery of trees, shrubs and ground vegetation in three tsunami-affected areas of the park. It also evaluated soil and water parameters like pH, conductivity and salinity. Although the tsunami impacted Yala's ecosystems, the park is still being studied for its unique coastal features and ability to recover from environmental disasters. Researchers continue monitoring factors like vegetation growth and soil salinity to support conservation efforts in this important Sri Lankan wildlife sanctuary.",
