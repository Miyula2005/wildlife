    <li>Yala National Park in Sri Lanka is home to a significant population of leopards, which are one of the main
      attractions for visitors to the park.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Researchers have developed a multi-point identification approach to recognize individual leopards in the park,
      which takes into account changes in spot and rosette formations over time.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>However, the high number of visitors to the park has led to safari operators aggressively pursuing leopards to
      satisfy visitor expectations, which threatens the wildlife populations.</li>

      including dense scrubland and forest that provide good cover for leopards to rest and ambush prey.</li>

    <li>The country's unique ecosystems, such as the Central Highlands, are home to endangered species like the Sri
      Lankan leopard.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Research conducted in Horton Plains National Park, located in the Central Highlands, has provided important
      insights into the density of leopards and their prey.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The study estimated a leopard density of 11.7 adult individuals per 100 square kilometers and highlighted the
      significance of the central grasslands as a key resource for prey, particularly Sambar, which in turn, is an
      important resource for leopards[1].</li>

  <h2><b>Poaching And Illegal Wild Trade </b></h2>
  <br>
  <br>

  <ul class="style-5">
    <li>Poaching and the illicit trade of wildlife in Sri Lanka pose significant threats to the country's biodiversity
      and conservation efforts. Some key aspects of this issue include:</li>
    <br>
    <li>1. <b class="illgl-1">Illegal capture and internal trade of wild Asian elephants</b>: A study documented 55
      cases of illegally
      traded elephants in Sri Lanka between January 2008 and December 2018. Nearly equal numbers of male and female
      elephants were traded, and more than 50% of them were juveniles aged ≤5 years.</li>
    <br>
    <li>2. <b class="illgl-2">Conservation challenges and risks for wildlife officers</b>: At least 80 wildlife officers
      in Sri Lanka
      have been killed in the line of duty since 1949, with the major causes of death being terrorist attacks,
      encounters with free-ranging Asian Elephants, and confrontations with wildlife criminals].</li>
    <br>
    <li>3. <b class="illgl-3">Obstacles to wildlife disease surveillance</b>: A study conducted in Sri Lanka identified
      obstacles to
      wildlife disease surveillance, including lack of transport facilities, skilled staff, infrastructure, human
      resources, training, and a mandate for getting involved in wildlife disease surveillance.</li>
    <br>
    <li>4. <b>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)</b>: CITES is a
      global agreement that regulates the trade of endangered species, with Sri Lanka being a member. Species listed in
      Appendix I and Appendix II are subject to strict regulations to ensure that trade does not threaten their
      survival.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Addressing poaching and the illicit trade of wildlife in Sri Lanka requires comprehensive conservation
      strategies, including strengthening enforcement efforts, raising public awareness, and improving the capacity of
      wildlife officers.</li>
