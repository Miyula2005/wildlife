                    </h3><br><b>Lanka's </b> lowland rainforests boast a diverse
                    array of
                    flora and fauna, characterized by a high level of endemism and specialization.
                    Covering 2.14 percent of the country's land area, these rainforests receive an annual rainfall
                    ranging
                    from 2,500 to 1,800 mm.
                    The Sinharaja Forest Reserve, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a significant
                    remnant of the original evergreen forests in the Wet Zone.
                    Remarkably, over 60% of its trees are endemic, and the reserve is a habitat for more than 50% of Sri
                    Lanka's endemic species of mammals and butterflies.Additionally, it supports various insects,
                    reptiles,
                    and rare amphibians.<br>

                    Rainforests, vital for conserving endemic species, support over 70% of Sri Lanka's endemic animals
                    and
                    plants, particularly in lowland rainforests.
                    Among Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, 20 belong to rainforest species.
                    Additionally, these rainforests serve as crucial catchment areas for major rivers, and their native
                    trees play a key role in preventing landslides.<br>

                    The vegetation in these rainforests is primarily influenced by a southwest monsoon, and the trees in
                    the
                    family Dipterocarpaceae dominate most Asian rainforests, with virtually all of the species in Sri
                    Lanka
                    being endemic to its rainforests.
                    The smaller plants also have high proportions of endemicity, usually indicating forest disturbance
                    levels.<br>

                    In summary, the lowland rainforests of Sri Lanka, particularly the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, are
                    vital
                    for the conservation of a wide range of endemic flora and fauna, making them an important ecological
                    and
                    biodiversity hotspot in the region.</p>

                    covering 2.14% of the land area, are crucial for conserving over 70% of the country's endemic
                    species.
                    The Sinharaja Forest Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, preserves the original evergreen forests
                    with over 60% endemic trees.
                    These rainforests, influenced by a southwest monsoon, harbor unique flora, including
                    <em>Dipterocarpaceae trees</em> endemic to Sri Lanka.
                    Serving as catchment areas for major rivers, they prevent landslides and support diverse fauna like
                    elephants and leopards.
                    Below 1,000 m elevation, these rainforests are a biodiversity hotspot, evolved over millennia in
                    isolation, playing a vital role in preserving Sri Lanka's natural heritage.</p>

                    This ecoregion covers most of Sri Lanka and is characterized by flat topography, receiving about
                    2,000
                    mm of annual rainfall during the northeast monsoon from December to March, but is mostly dry during
                    the
                    rest of the year.
                    The Dry Zone includes the northern part of the country and much of the east and southeast.
                    The region is significant for agriculture, with varied flow rivers being a major asset for
                    irrigation in
                    the drier parts of the country.
                    The Dry Zone is also a site for the study of aquaculture development within farmer-managed
                    irrigation
                    systems.
                    The dry evergreen forests in this region are made up mostly of evergreen trees, which distinguish
                    them
                    from the deciduous trees that characterize most other tropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregions.
                    The Dry Zone has been the focus of various development programs, including the Mahaweli Development
                    Program, aimed at intensifying crop production systems in the region.</p>

                    the
                    Central Highlands and Knuckles mountains, with their best development seen above 1,500 m.
                    These forests are also known as cloud forests due to the condensation of hot air from the lowlands,
                    resulting in afternoon rains.
                    They cover about 1.1% of the land area and are characterized by a marked difference in floristic
                    composition and physiognomy compared to the sub-montane forests of middle elevation.
                    The structure of these forests is less complex, with all trees more or less arranged in a single
                    layer,
                    and their canopies typically reach heights of about 30 feet.
                    Approximately 50% of all species in these forests are endemic to Sri Lanka.
                    The tropical lower montane forests are cooler than lowland forests, providing ideal conditions for
                    the
                    growth of cloud forests.
                    They are rich in biodiversity, with half of Sri Lanka's endemic flowering plants and 51% of the
                    endemic
                    vertebrates being restricted to these forests.
                    These forests are also home to twisted, stunted trees, various orchids, mosses, and ferns.
                    The montane rain forests cover 3,099.5 ha in total, or 0.05% of Sri Lanka's total area, and are

                    Hakgala.
                    At lower elevations, between 1,000–1,500 m, sub-montane forests occur, accounting for 1.04% of the
