        Department of Wildlife Conservation is a government agency in Sri Lanka responsible for the conservation and
        management of the country's wildlife resources.
        It was established in 1949 and is responsible for the implementation of wildlife conservation policies, laws,
        and regulations.<br><br>
        The department manages national parks, wildlife reserves, and sanctuaries, and is also involved in research,
        education, and awareness-raising activities.
        The department works to protect and conserve Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity, including its many endemic species,
        and to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.<br><br></p>

        <li>The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) in Sri Lanka is responsible for the protection and
            conservation of biodiversity, and prevention of commercial and other misuse of fauna, flora and their
            habitats in Sri Lanka.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The main duties of field level wildlife officers with regard to protection and conservation of biodiversity
            in the country include wildlife crime investigation and taking legal actions against offenders. However,
            there are some loopholes in the existing system that affect the effective implementation of legal actions at
            the ground level.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The DWC is also responsible for the long-term conservation and protection of biological diversity in Sri
            Lanka.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The department provides compulsory training to staff and has facilities for researchers, and is currently
            being developed to become an International Training School.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The department has faced challenges in undertaking wildlife disease surveillance due to obstacles such as
            lack of transport facilities, skilled staff, infrastructure, human resources, training, and a mandate for
            getting involved in wildlife disease surveillance.</li>
